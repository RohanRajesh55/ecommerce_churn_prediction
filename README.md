# E-commerce Customer Churn Prediction

This project implements an end-to-end machine learning pipeline that predicts customer churn for an e-commerce business. The solution covers data ingestion, preprocessing, model training (with hyperparameter tuning), evaluation, and deployment via an interactive web application built with Streamlit.

---

## 🚀 Project Overview

The goal of this project is to identify customers who are likely to churn, allowing businesses to proactively engage and retain them. Key components of the project include:

- **Data Ingestion & Preprocessing:**  
  Data is loaded from an Excel file and processed using a scikit-learn pipeline. Both numeric and categorical features are transformed (with techniques like imputation, scaling, and one-hot encoding).

- **Model Training & Hyperparameter Tuning:**  
  An XGBoost classifier is trained with optional hyperparameter tuning using Optuna. The model's performance is evaluated using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, F1 score, ROC-AUC, and PR-AUC.

- **Deployment:**  
  The trained model, along with its preprocessing pipeline, is saved as a full pipeline. A Streamlit web app (`deploy.py`) leverages this pipeline to provide interactive churn predictions based on user inputs.

## ⚙️ Installation

1. **Clone the Repository:**

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/ecommerce_churn_prediction.git
cd ecommerce_churn_prediction
````

2. **Create a Virtual Environment and Install Dependencies:**

```bash
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate      # On Windows, use: venv\Scripts\activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

3. **(Optional) Configure Environment Variables:**

If your project requires sensitive settings (e.g., API keys), create a `.env` file in the project root:

```
YOUR_VARIABLE=value
```

---

## 🔧 Configuration

All settings (e.g., file paths, model parameters) are managed in the `config.yml` file. Adjust these settings based on your environment. Example:

```yaml
paths:
  raw_data: "data/raw/E Commerce Dataset.xlsx"
  model_output: "models/best_model.pkl"
  optuna_study_output: "models/optuna_study.pkl"
  model_output_full: "models/full_pipeline_model.pkl"

data:
  sheet_name: "E Comm"
  target: "Churn"
  test_size: 0.2

modeling:
  use_gpu: false
  xgb_params:
    n_estimators: 300
    max_depth: 5
    learning_rate: 0.1
    subsample: 0.8
    colsample_bytree: 0.8
```

## 🧪 How to Run

### 1. Model Training and Evaluation

Run the following command to execute the complete training and evaluation pipeline:

```bash
python main.py
```

This script will:

- Load and preprocess the dataset.
- Train the XGBoost model (with optional hyperparameter tuning).
- Evaluate the model using various metrics.
- Save both the standalone model and the full pipeline (preprocessor + model) for deployment.

---

### 2. Model Deployment (Streamlit App)

To launch the interactive web app:

```bash
streamlit run app/deploy.py
```

This will open a browser window with a form where you can input customer details and receive a churn prediction along with its probability.
